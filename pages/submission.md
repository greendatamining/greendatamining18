Overlength papers will be rejected without review (papers with smaller page margins
and font sizes than specified in the author instructions and set in the style files will
also be treated as overlength).

## Reviewing Process

Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of technical quality, novelty, potential impact, and clarity.
