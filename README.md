# Call For Papers


## Scope

This workshop aims to bring together people from many different fields in machine learning and data mining that have a common interest in energy efficiency, energy aware computing, hardware accelerators, and embedded systems. 
These fields include, but are not limited to: deep learning, big data, Internet of Things (IoT), 
large-scale computing, stream mining, and distributed machine learning. 
The goal is to provide a venue for researchers to present their work, exchange ideas, 
and discuss challenges related to energy efficiency in machine learning, data mining, 
and supporting hardware platforms, and algorithms. 
We accept original work, already completed, or in progress. Position papers are also welcomed.
